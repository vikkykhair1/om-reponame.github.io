        <ol>
            <li>Users must note that ‘Ludo’ game available for challenge in our platform is ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian law, and that we does not support, endorse or offer to Users ‘games of chance’ for money.

            <li>The games rules are clearly defined on this platform and Users are encouraged to read, understand and follow these rules to be successful in these games.</li>

            <li>Dear user kindly reset your password immediately after registration for avoiding any misuse of your account.</li>
            <li>Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form of challenges / obstacles that a User would be able to overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical so Users must use their skills in order to be successful</li>
            <li>Since the games available on our platform can be won through Users’ skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, the performance of a User may improve with time and practice.</li>
